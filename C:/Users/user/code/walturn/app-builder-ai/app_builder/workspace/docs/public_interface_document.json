{"package_name":"com.walturn","project_description":"A comprehensive Flutter application utilizing the Cubit pattern for state management. This app is designed to be modular, maintainable, and scalable, adhering to Flutter best practices.","architecture_overview":"The application follows a modular architecture with a clear separation of concerns. The Cubit pattern is used for state management, ensuring a predictable and manageable state flow.
